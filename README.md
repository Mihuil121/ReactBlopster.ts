## About the project

ReactBlopster.ts is a web application designed to demonstrate deep immersion in TypeScript (TS) and its interaction with React. The project was developed as a platform for the virtual toy store "Blop Top", providing a convenient and interactive way for users to browse and buy toys online.

### Motivation

The goal of the project was not only to study TypeScript and React, but also to create a functional web application that could serve as an example of effective use of strict TS typing to improve development and integration with the reactive React user interface.

## Description of the "Blop Top" store

Blop Top is not just a toy store, it is a whole creative community dedicated to creating unique soft anti-stress toys. Founded in April 2020, during the pandemic, "Blop Top" began its journey by exploring Japanese trash games, which led to the creation of viral videos in TikTok and gaining millions of views. The most popular format was a board game where players had to guess a character from a popular universe.

Since then, Blop Top has grown into a major toy manufacturer, regularly releasing new collections in response to the demands of its audience. Toys such as Horseradish and Flip-Flops have become brand symbols, winning the hearts of fans and becoming coveted objects in collections around the world.

### The story of "Blop Top"

- **Beginning**: The "Blop Top" channel was created in April 2020, when founders Sasha and Marina began experimenting with trash games to create content.
- **First toys**: The first batch of toys was announced in May 2021 and included a llama, a parrot, a duck, a pigeon and a chicken. Despite the mixed reviews, production continued, and "Blop Top" began to produce toys that quickly became popular.
- **Development**: Blop Top continues to release new collections, including horror toys and exclusive unreleased models, expanding its line and strengthening its connection with the community.

### Creative community "Blop Top"

Blop Top not only produces toys, but is also home to a wide range of creative projects, including games, comics and various media formats. This community is actively involved in content creation, contributing to the "Blop Top" Wiki, and maintains an active presence on social media, including YouTube, Telegram, and TikTok.

### A call to action

"Blop Top" invites everyone to join their creative movement by contributing to the Wiki, creating new articles and expanding the history of "Blop Top" from the first video to the latest achievements.

### Technologies
